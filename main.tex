\chapter*{Abstract}
Over the relatively recent years, \textbf{reinforcement learning (RL)} has gained immense popularity.
Stemming from the agent-based approach to artificial intelligence, RL is a unique paradigm within its field.

RL has a broad focus -- researchers have trained RL agents to solve a variety of tasks.
Among its applications were the AlphaGo family of Go programs \cite{ago, alpha-zero} which became world renowned after they defeated Lee Sedol, 18-times world champion, thus becoming the first computer system achieving superhuman perfomance in the game of Go.

However, a multitude of interesting results in this field focuses on agents learning in video games or other game-like environments.
In \emph{Mnih et al.}'s 2013 \emph{Atari DQN} paper \cite{atari-dqn} (which is covered in this work), the DeepMind team proposes a method to train agents to learn how to play Atari video games exclusively from raw video input.

Despite seeming a toy problem, learning to solve virtual environments from raw sensory input provides insight about real-time, real-world environments such as self-driving cars.

In this paper, we similarly use RL methods to solve a game-like environment.
We choose to solve \emph{Pacman}, for its simple mechanics but potentially complex situations that can emerge.
In order to train our agent, we will use the DQN method, similar to the one described in the Atari DQN paper \cite{atari-dqn}.
We elaborate on the theoretical framework of \emph{Q-learning} on which the paper is built.
Finally, we document the resulting approach and construct an implementation.
