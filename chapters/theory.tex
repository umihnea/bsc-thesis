\section{AI and Machine Learning}
% Here we describe what ML is and how to classify various methods under ML.

\section{Reinforcement Learning}
% Here we introduce many fundamental notions of reinforcement learning.

\section{Q-Learning}
% Here we start by describing naive Q-learning

% then we introduce deep Q-learning
% in this subsec, we will also do a quick introduction to neural networks

\section{Deep Q-Learning}

% Here we do a rundown of possible improvements of Q-learning: Double Q-learning and Duelling Q-learning

% Perhaps we can include DQN in the original Atari paper
