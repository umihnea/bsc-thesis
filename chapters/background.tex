This chapter introduces the concepts necessary to understanding the subject of this thesis.
We aim to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item present the central pieces of an \emph{agent-based approach} in artificial intelligence: agent and environment;
    \item explain how we can reason about problems using this paradigm;
    \item introduce key concepts in the field of \emph{reinforcement learning (RL)};
    \item describe \emph{Q-learning} and how we can use neural networks to improve the classic algorithm;
    \item exemplify a successful application of this approach.
\end{itemize}
